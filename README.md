# Review-Analysis

This project aims to perform a Sentiment Analysis of product-based reviews. Collection of data and analysing it will be the prime task. Most of the websites fail toshow correct product reviews, the user is confused and is not able to come up with aproper conclusion. We aim to come up with a solution in which each user gives his orher review and on the basis of their review, we predict the accurate review of theproduct and it is updated dynamically whenever a new review comes up, so rating changes accordingly. This will provide the buyer with a positive response.
